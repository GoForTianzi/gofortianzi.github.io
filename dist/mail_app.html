                <li>From research, I learned that family vans are Toyota and Honda's best sellers in Japan. Therefore, I drew nature elements in the temaplate for staff's use. </li>
                <li>For understanding of the project scope and UX, I created use case and persona.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Outcome & Result</h3>

            <p>
                The project is still under development, and the template was to be presented to client.
            </p>
            </ul>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <ul class="descrip-list">
                <li> I think the ready-made elements in the template will improve staff work efficiency.
                </li>
                <li>As there are still uncleared process in the use case, the project requires further communication with the programmer and client.</li>
                </li>
