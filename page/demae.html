            <h2>UI/UX Design</h2>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Demae-can 出前館, in Japanese meaning "Delivered-to-You Pavillion", is a food delivery business in Japan. Due to market escalation during corona virus, the company expands the design team. I was asked to redesign the website in visitor mode for
                the job interview.
            </p>

            <h3>Original Webpage</h3>

            <h3>Redesign</h3>
            <img class="fw_image" src="../assets/img/Demae-can_wire.png" />


            <h3> Goal</h3>
            <p>Improve UX and increase new user registration</p>

            <h3>User</h3>
            <p>Customer, restaurant owner & job seeker</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <ul class="descrip-list">
                <li>I adapted Yelp's use of user-produced photo banner to increase credibility.</li>
                <li>I replaced the round food genre image with rectangluar banner for readibility.</li>
                <li>I used responsive grid to build consistency.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <ul class="descrip-list">
                <li> The design was well received by the team. </li>
                <li>One of the question asked was to let me define what is good design, and I said that yelp's uphold of user-produced photos was more credible than professional photos in this context; therefore, that could be called good design in my opinion.
                </li>
            </ul>
