            <h1>Vitalizing Ramen Bonvo</h1>
            <h2>Illustration, Photo & Graphic Design</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>Ramen Bonvo, started by two young gentlemen in their 20's, already has two stores opened since 2019. I was asked to create an outdoor poster to attract tourists and locals, as well as to highlight their effort to preserve the old taste.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <ul class="descrip-list">
                <li> <a href="https://kosanji.com/chojujinbutsugiga/">"Chojugiga"</a> is a Japanese ancient scroll painting depicting anthromorphic animals playing, chasing near creeks. Some interprete it as a political satire and recognize the painting as
                    the early pioneer of modern Japanese manga. I drew the animal characters cooking ramen and pork bowl to attract tourists.
                </li>
                <li>I adapted the classic chain shop, Ohoshou's color scheme and photo style to show family friendliness and customized Bonvo's Gothic typeface for the text.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <ul class="descrip-list">
                <li>The poster expressed owner's wish to inherit the traditional taste and to create new things.</li>
                <li>One location is near a pachinko, where some bet small and hope to win all day. I wish I created a campaign that would bring them warmth.</li>
