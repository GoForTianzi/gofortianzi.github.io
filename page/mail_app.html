            <h1>Toyota Retailer Mail App</h1>
            <h2>User Resesarch, UX & Print</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>While working at Kinki Research Center, I helped redesign Toyota retailer company's mail web app to help staff create client mail.</p>
            <h3>Template Redesign</h3>

                <img class="two_one" src="../assets/img/k_card_0615_2.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <h3>Original</h3>
            <figure class="img-div">
                <img class="two_one" src="../assets/img/k_orig_1.jpg" />

                <img class="two_one" src="../assets/img/k_orig_2.jpg" />
            </figure>

            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>Improve UX and template design</p>

            <h3>User</h3>
            <p>Staff, Manager & Customer</p>


            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>I was main designer in collaboration with boss/chief programmer, <br>working part-time for four months</p>


            <h3>Constraints</h3>
            <ul class="descrip-list">
                <li>Unable to talk to client or user directly.</li>
                <li>PDF-extracted text requires manual adjustments and cannot be stylized. </li>
                <li>Staff and customer are new to apps and training cost is high.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <ul class="descrip-list">
                <li>I learned that family vans are Toyota and Honda's best sellers in Japan. Therefore, I drew nature elements in the template to invoke the travel vibe. </li>
                <li>To communicate project scope with the programmer and to improve UX, I created use case and persona.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/>
            <ol class="process-container">
                <h3>Staff Use Case</h3>
                <li>Staff opens up the app, thinking after sending out the cards, some would visit soon. </li>

                <li>Upload customer CSV sheet. Start editing. </li>
                <li>Begin with Staff Note. Type. Save.</li>
                <li>Move on to Sales Campaign. Use ready-made campaign designs. Move on to Recommended Car.</li>
                <li>Choose car-recommendation-related columns from CSV sheet.
                    <br/>For customers that have interested car models, upload images accordingly.
                    <br/>For those who do not, recommend base on current car type or omit the section.</li>
                <li>Move on to Toyota app launch info. Use existing design. Front-side finished.</li>

                <li>Move on to customer address section. Choose name-and-address-related columns from CSV. Input in card.</li>

                <li>Move on to point exchange method explained section. Define point gift image base on royalty levels.</li>
                <li>Move on to contact section. Use stored data of staff name and store address.
                    <li>Move on to HQ address section. Default info is fine. Design finished. </li>
                    <li>Print sample using the printer in the office. Look good. </li>
                    <li> Generate 100 mails. Check on screen? Send data to print shop.</li>
            </ol>

            <ul class="process-container">
                <h3>HQ Manager Persona</h3>

                <li>Have been working on the point exchange campaign for three years. Excited to finally launch it.</li>
                <li>Oversee eight stores sales campaign.</li>
                <li>Want to check postal design for unhealthy competitions among stores or staff. </li>

                <li>Postal designs are sent based on point levels. </li>
                <li>If there are four levels: under 3,000, 3,000+, 10000+, 20,000+, Then 4 levels x 32 staffs = 128 postal designs. Does he need to check both sides of the design, or only the staff note section?</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="process-container">
                <h3>Questions</h3>
                <li>What kind of unhealthy competition is he worried? </li>
                <li>Is he trying to connect sales result with a perticular staff's card design? </li>
